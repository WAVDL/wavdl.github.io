# About me

For my day job, I'm a software engineer. I graduated from The Ohio State University in 2017 and I've now worked for three Fortune 500 companies. My opinions here do not represent any of my current or former employers. If you're a potential future employer, you may be more interested in my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-van-der-laar/) page.

I've lived in Columbus, Baltimore, San Francisco, and now Columbus again. I've been living car-free since July 2021. I take pride in moving through my city without creating unnecessary congestion, pollution, or traffic violence. I believe that a better world is possible, and I believe in creating that world wherever possible in my own lifestyle and in my community.
