# Welcome

I don't have a very clearly defined purpose for this website. Maybe it's a fun experiment, maybe it's to lay claim to my
own slice of the world wide web, maybe I just want to brag about [my ranking in Rocket League](/ranks/).

I don't use LLMs or "AI" tools to write, edit, or brainstorm any of the content I post on this site. This is a site
created by a human and intended for human consumption.
