I went on a walk today to return a library book. I knew they would be closed, so I looked for the book return drop-off. The only option was to walk into the drive-through. A convenience just for drivers, so they could stay in their cars and not have to step onto the sidewalk.

I grabbed a coffee and took the long way home. I breathed in the polluted air and observed the lifeless streets full of rapid traffic. I passed by the Starbucks with a line of cars stretched around the corner idling. I passed the McDonald's where I watch dozens of drivers pick up their breakfast every cold weekday morning while I stand at the bus stop. They can't be bothered to speak to the workers face to face. They order through a speaker box.

"Stay in your car"

They were in their car before ever leaving their home. The double garage door opens and their machine emerges into the world so that they don't have to.

"Stay in your car"

Finally, I passed the new oil change garage on the corner. Bigger than the brand name, bigger than descriptions of sales or offers, was a giant sign.
